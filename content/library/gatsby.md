## About The Great Gatsby

F. Scott Fitzgerald's timeless tale of Jay Gatsby's pursuit of the American Dream and his obsessive love for Daisy Buchanan. Set in the summer of 1922, the story is narrated by Nick Carraway, who becomes Gatsby's neighbor and witness to the tragic events that unfold.

The novel captures the excess and moral emptiness of the wealthy elite during the Jazz Age, while exploring themes of love, idealism, resistance to change, and the corruption of the American Dream.

## Key Themes

- **The American Dream**: Gatsby's rise from poverty and his belief that he can recreate the past
- **Social class**: The divide between old money (Tom and Daisy) and new money (Gatsby)
- **Moral decay**: The carelessness and moral emptiness of the wealthy
- **The past vs. present**: Gatsby's inability to accept that the past is gone

## My Thoughts

Fitzgerald's prose is simply beautiful - every sentence is crafted with care. The symbolism is rich without being heavy-handed, from the green light to the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg.

What strikes me most is how relevant the themes remain today. The critique of wealth inequality, the pursuit of status, and the hollowness of material success feel as timely as ever. Gatsby himself is both admirable in his hope and tragic in his delusion.

A perfect novel that deserves its place in the American literary canon.
