A collection of software engineering projects, product ideas, and creative endeavors. This portfolio showcases both active work and archived experimentsâ€”because sometimes the projects that don't make it teach us the most.

**Current Projects** are actively being developed or maintained, while the **Project Cemetery** contains abandoned or completed projects with insights about what worked, what didn't, and what I learned along the way.
