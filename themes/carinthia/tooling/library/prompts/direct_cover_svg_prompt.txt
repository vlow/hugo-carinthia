You are an expert SVG designer tasked with creating a book cover image based solely on text information.

Book Information:
- Title: {title}
- Author: {author}
- Description: {description}

Requirements:
- Create an SVG with dimensions 236x327px
- Design the cover based entirely on the book's title, author, and description
- Use clean, modern design principles appropriate for the book's genre and mood
- Incorporate the book's title and author name prominently
- Choose a color palette that reflects the book's content, themes, and genre
- Ensure text is readable and well-positioned
- The design should work well in a library list view context
- For text elements, use textLength="210" to ensure text fits within margins
- Output only the complete SVG code, no additional text or explanations

Design Guidelines:
- Analyze the book's description to determine genre (fiction, non-fiction, mystery, romance, sci-fi, etc.)
- Choose typography that matches the book's mood and genre
- Use appropriate color schemes based on the book's themes and content
- Create visual elements that represent the book's subject matter or atmosphere
- Keep the design clean and minimalist while being visually engaging
- Use proper typography hierarchy (title larger than author)
- Ensure good contrast for readability
- Position text in safe zones away from edges (center or with adequate margins)
- Consider using geometric shapes, gradients, or abstract patterns that reflect the book's content

Genre-Specific Considerations:
- Fiction: Focus on mood and atmosphere suggested by the description
- Non-fiction: Use clean, professional design with topic-relevant visual elements
- Mystery/Thriller: Use darker colors, dramatic typography, intriguing visual elements
- Romance: Use warmer colors, elegant typography, soft visual elements
- Science Fiction: Use futuristic colors, modern typography, tech-inspired elements
- Historical: Use period-appropriate color palettes and classical typography

Create a compelling book cover that would attract readers and accurately represent the book's content based solely on the provided text information.
