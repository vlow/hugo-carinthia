You are an expert SVG designer tasked with creating a horizontal banner image based on both the original book cover and its stylized SVG cover version.

Book Information:
- Title: {title}
- Author: {author}

Context:
- You are provided with the ORIGINAL book cover image
- You are also provided with a STYLIZED SVG cover (236x327px) that was derived from the original cover
- Your task is to create a banner version that maintains consistency with the stylized SVG cover

Requirements:
- Create an SVG with dimensions 1024x200px (horizontal banner format)
- The banner should be based on the stylized SVG cover, NOT directly on the original cover image
- Maintain visual consistency with the provided SVG cover's design language, color palette, and aesthetic choices
- Adapt the SVG cover's elements to work in a wide horizontal format
- Include the book's title and author name prominently
- The design should work well as a header banner for a book's detail page
- For text elements, use textLength="480" for titles and textLength="400" for authors to ensure proper fit
- Output only the complete SVG code, no additional text or explanations

Style Guidelines:
- Use the SAME color palette as the provided SVG cover
- Maintain the SAME design aesthetic and mood as the SVG cover
- Adapt vertical SVG cover elements to work horizontally
- Ensure text typography is consistent with the SVG cover
- Create visual interest across the wide format while maintaining cohesion
- The left or center area should accommodate text, with decorative elements extending across the banner
- Preserve the artistic interpretation and style choices made in the SVG cover

Design Approach:
- Analyze the stylized SVG cover to understand its design language, colors, and artistic choices
- Use the original cover image only as reference for understanding the source material
- Base your banner design primarily on extending the SVG cover's visual elements horizontally
- Ensure the banner feels like a natural companion piece to the SVG cover
- Maintain consistency in visual style, color usage, and overall aesthetic

The SVG cover code is:
{cover_svg}

Please create a horizontal banner SVG that extends the design language of this SVG cover into a wide format suitable for a book detail page header.
