### Hi, I'm Florian.
I have been working in software engineering for over 15 years.
I work as an Engineering Director.
My job, along with my passion for building and thinking about things, often leads to ideas and side projects.

I decided that I want to write more again, so this is the place where I talk about them (and sometimes put them to rest).
