## About Foundation

Isaac Asimov's Foundation is the first book in his legendary Foundation series. Set in a future where humanity has spread across the galaxy, the story follows mathematician Hari Seldon who develops psychohistory - a science that can predict the future of large populations.

When Seldon foresees the fall of the Galactic Empire and a dark age lasting 30,000 years, he establishes two Foundations to preserve knowledge and reduce the dark age to just 1,000 years.

## The Foundation Universe

This book introduces key concepts that would define Asimov's universe:
- Psychohistory and the mathematics of social prediction
- The Encyclopedia Galactica project
- The concept of the Seldon Crisis
- The role of science and knowledge in civilization

## My Thoughts

Foundation feels more like a collection of connected stories than a traditional novel, but that works in its favor. Each section presents a different crisis that tests the Foundation's survival, showcasing Asimov's genius for combining hard science with compelling storytelling.

The ideas about the cyclical nature of civilizations and the power of knowledge to shape history feel incredibly relevant today.
